Project 03: Web App for Task Management

Michael Zeno

• Overview/description: 
The Daily Planner website is intended to allow users to keep a running list of tasks and contacts. 

• Details/functionality:
From the home page they will have the option to use the top navigation menu to switch to either the Tasks or Contacts page. 
The tasks page will allow users to create new tasks, mark tasks as completed, delete tasks, and sort the task list by 'all', 
'active', or 'complete'. The contacts page is seperated into both a new contact form, and a contact list. Fropm the contact form
users can create new contacts and from the list they will be able to see all the contacts that have been added.

• Technologies Used:
HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap 4.0, JavaScript, React, Redux

• Ideas for future improvement (minimum of 3)
	1. Assign a contact to each task.
	2. Filter task list by contact. 
	3. Add a pop-up modal to confirm deletion of items.
	4. Validations on all input fields.
